So when I was able to visit <strong>Ch&acirc;teau de Pierrefonds</strong>&nbsp;in France I was thrilled! Many of you may know it from the <strong>TV series &lsquo;Merlin&rsquo; where it served as Camelot</strong>. Let me tell you, it is as magical as Merlin himself! I was just in awe of the castle! It&rsquo;s tremendous and magnificently beautiful! Tucked in a small town in France, it&rsquo;s not a big tourist attraction so I felt as if I had the castle to myself. I&rsquo;d love to go back again some day!</p>

The first time I was able to <strong>climb about 300 feet high hill at Rijuk Waterfall</strong>, Ruma in the Bandarban district of Bangladesh. Yeah, last year during Rainy Season I got the chance to visit one of the most natural and beautiful Rijuk Waterfall. I got scared of heights, it was risky to climb because of rainfall, but <strong>I didn&rsquo;t take a single moment to think when I got an offer to climb</strong>. And of course, I didn&rsquo;t forget to manage a smiling snap while climbing that hill.</p>

"14","What happens in Venice stays in Venice – my Selfie Stick Fiasco","<p>There I was. In Venice. In Italy. For real. A backpacker visiting a house transformed into a beautiful museum. I had just discovered there was a magnificent terrace perched on the Grand Canal. I completely fell in love with the place. The colors, the sparkling water, the calm of this hidden gem, a real happy place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to immortalize this singular moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I took it out, for the first time, this mystery object that everyone was talking about, this thing that is supposed to be an essential because it takes your pictures to the next level. I had finally given in and purchased a selfie stick.</p>

<p>I was shy to use it, a bit of a rookie technology.</p>

<p>So I waited to be alone. I deployed it and put my phone on it like it should have been. But it was not. Unfortunately.</p>

<p>It fell apart and it was not supposed to.</p>

<p>My phone dropped on the floor and it was not supposed to.</p>

<p>It slid and went directly underneath the small opening of the fence. And it was not supposed to.</p>

<p>So there I was. In Venice. Admiring and cursing the Grand Canal. For real.</p>
